üìö Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, and machine learning. This project focuses on solving [specific problem, e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification, language translation, etc.] using modern NLP techniques. The aim is to process and derive meaningful insights from textual data, enabling applications such as chatbots, recommendation systems, and content analysis.

üßπ Data Cleaning Techniques

Text preprocessing is critical for achieving accurate and reliable NLP results. 

Text Normalization: Lowercasing, removing special characters, punctuation, and numbers.

Tokenization: Splitting text into individual tokens or meaningful chunks.

Stopword Removal: Eliminating non-essential words (e.g., "and," "the").

Stemming & Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root forms to improve consistency.

Noise Removal: Filtering out URLs, hashtags, mentions, and other irrelevant data.

Spell Correction: Addressing typos to enhance text quality.


üîç Machine Learning Approach

Workflow:
Feature Extraction: Techniques like TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and BERT embeddings.

Model Selection:

Traditional models: Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM.

Deep Learning: LSTM, GRU, Transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT).

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, and Recall for measuring performance.
